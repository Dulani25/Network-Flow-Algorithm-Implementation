# Network-Flow-Algorithm-Implementation

Developed and implemented a maximum flow algorithm for directed graphs using Java. Designed a custom data structure for flow networks, implemented a parser to read network descriptions, and applied graph algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson to compute the optimal flow. Conducted performance analysis using Big-O notation to evaluate algorithm efficiency.
